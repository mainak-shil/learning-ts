eliminate manually compile tsc js filename

$ npm i --save-dev lite-server // hot-reload

## Basic and type

https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html

  types: 
  - number 1,4.5
  - string 'Hi' "Hi" `HI`
  - boolean
  - object
  - Array
  - Tuple
  - *Enum : Human readable identifiers
  -   : avoid the type warning(not recommended)
  - Union : number | string
  - Literal
  - Alias/ custom types
  - void : ignore any return,
  - function type and callbacks
  - unknown
  - never
  
-- typescript understand the default datatype of a variable
 so no need to mention any type unless a value is explicitly assigned.
 // or TypeScript would be able to infer the type

 Q/A What's the difference between JavaScript types 
 (e.g. typeof 'Max' => 'string') and TypeScript types (e.g. const name: string = '...')?
-JS has no compilation step but at runtime, you can check for certain types 
(e.g. in if conditions). TS on the other hand allows you to catch certain errors during 
development since it checks types during compilation as well.

## Object types
   define specific object types to tell ts

  - tuple - This tells TypeScript, I want to have a special array with exactly two 
  elements, because I have exactly two types in there, and the first element should 
  be a number. The second element should be a string

   - Union : If we have some place in our application, be that a parameter of a function or a constant or a variable,
where using somewhere where we accept two different kinds of values, well, then a union type can help
us to tell typescript that we are fine with either a number or a string.
We use number and then the pipe.
Symbol here and then the other type we always accept, and you can have more than two types, you can
accept as many types here as you need.

## fn return types & void
 - no return type = void

## function type and callbacks
  - callback: callback functions can return something, even if the argument on 
  which they're passed does NOT expect a returned value.
  - function type: defines the parameters and return type of a function

## unknown: different and better than any
  - declaring a variable as unknown and assigning to any type suppose int and after string
  will be accepted as any
  - need extra type check...if type is string -> assign string
  - better than any

## never : case for a function doesn't returns anything, may be a error or have only while block
thrown fn



#### compiler and config
----------------------------------------------------------------

## watch mode single file: tsc filename -w (or --watch)
## watch mode multiple file (as a project): 
    tsc --init (init typescript project)
    tsc or tsc --watch

    --- creates a file tsconfig.json ---

## exclude files to get ignored to compiled
    "exclude": ["fileName","or pattern"]
## include files to get ignored to compiled
    "include": ["fileName","or pattern"] [" "**/*.tsx""]
## target: which es method would need to compile, will be compiles as js andin perticular with that
    "target": "es2016" / "es5"

## lib: if the lib option is not set, some defaults some apis are assumed like DOM.
    You need to have TypeScript run in the browser.
    So all the DOM APIs and so on.

    can't be array empty
    "lib": ["dom","es6","DOM.Iterable","ScriptHost"]

## allowJs/checkJs : allowJs/checkJs include JavaScript files in the compilation 
    allowJs a JavaScript file will e compiled by TypeScript.

## jsx: for react
## declaration/declarationMap: .d.ts :  manifest for npm module
## sourceMap: ** simplifies debugging
    if true : act as bridge with some generated files(js.map) which understood by modern
    browsers and developer tools there to connect js files to input files
    - enables ts files with js files in source in developer tools, easy to debug and breakpoints

## outDir/rootDir: organize the js files and js generated files
   set dist folder to output js folder
   outDir:'./dist
   rootDir:"./src -- input files

## removeComments: remove comments in compilation
## noEmit : doesn't generate any js files, needs just to check the ts files for errors 
## noEmitOnError: false: despite an error will generate js files/compiles
                  true: problematic files will not generate

## strict: enable or all other to individually enables
## noImplicitAny:false : ignores the fn parameter
## strictNullChecks: tell ts how to access and work with values that might potentially hold value/null

  ! operator: yield a non null value
  document.querySelector("button")!


## strictBindCallApply: check if we correctly using bind with appropriate arguments and parameters
## strictPropertyInitialization: working with classes
## noImplicitThis : this keyword and types basically tries to warn you if you use the this keyword
    in a place where it's not clear what it refers to 
## alwaysStrict: controls that the JavaScript files which are generated are using
    strict mode so that this is added.

    -- code quality related --
## noUnusedLocals:
## noUnusedParameters: warnings for unused codes/parameters
## noImplicitReturns : check if we returned something in a implicit functions



## vscode debugger

-- enable sourcemap in tsconfig
- debugger for chrome extension
- 

## classes 

    -- private : #employees - assigned as private property of methods
    -- SHORT HAND INITIALIZATION IN CONSTRUCTOR

        class Department2 {
        // public name: string;
        // #employees: string[] = [];

        constructor(public name: string) {}
        
    -- readOnly : ===> const
        class Department2 {
            // public name: string;
            // #employees: string[] = [];

            constructor(private readonly id: string) {}

    -- inheritance: single class inheritance
    
    -- protected : can override inherited props and implementation

    -- getter/setter :  need to access or store a private property

            set report()
            get report()
