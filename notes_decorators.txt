Creating and Using TypeScript 3 Decorators
By David Tucker

Decorators
- cross cutting data rules

...... Globomantics

"Decorators provide a way to add both
annotations and a meta-programming syntax
for class declarations and members.
decoratorS are available as an experimental
feature of TypeScript."


TypeScript Decorator Example

@controller ("/api")
class APIServer {

  @log("Route added to API Server ")
  publ1c addRoute(path:string, action: Action ) {
  this.app.addRoute (path, action) ;

  }
}

---- cross-cutting concerns ----

---- decorators & annotations ----

TypeScript decorators are different from annotation from other programming languages

Annotations are limited to setting metadata
Decorators are fn that can modify what they describe when executed

---- types decorators ----
class | method | property | parameter


tsconfig
experimentalDecorator true
emitDecoratorMetadata true
